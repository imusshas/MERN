- What is DNS?
 • DNS is just like the underline service of a phone call. As in a phone call a name gets mapped to a number. Likewise, a URL gets mapped to an IP address via a DNS. 
  [https://dns.google/ -> 8.8.8.8]
  [https://www.google.com/ -> 142.250.182.174]
  • Another advantage of DNS is different URLs can have the same IP running on different ports.

- Can I search something via IP?
  Yes, you can. Just like making a phone call via a number.
